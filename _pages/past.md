## My Start of Middle School

<img src="/images/pages/math.jpg" alt="Math" class="page_image">

* I knew nothing about programming
* However, I did like math, but never applied my skills in any way

---

## My First Breakthrough

<img src="/images/pages/scratch.png" alt="Scratch" class="page_image">

* One day, I saw my sister was doing block-based coding
  * I decided to try it out, and loved it
* My first "aha!" moment
  * I could finally apply my math/logic skills
  * I had discovered my passion for programming

---

## Example projects

<div class="gallery" data-columns="3">
  {% for file in site.static_files %}
  {% if file.path contains 'images/gallery/block_coding' %}
  <img src="{{ file.path }}" alt="{{ file.name }}">
  {%endif%}
  {% endfor %}
</div>

## The Core Competencies

<img src="/images/pages/core_competencies.png" alt="Core Competencies" class="page_image">

* Communication
  * Not as strong
  * Not as much experience interacting with others
* Thinking
  * I was quite strong, because of my math/logic skills
  * Programming would really help me develop this core competency
* Personal and social
  * Didn't fully have a concrete idea of who I was yet

---

## What I had learned so far

<img src="/images/pages/future_road.jpg" alt="Future Road" class="page_image">

* Discovered my passion
* Better understanding of what I enjoy as an individual
* Basic idea of what I would want to do in the future

---

High school would be the next big step for me!

## My Second Breakthrough

<img src="/images/pages/intro_python.png" alt="Basic Python Coding" class="page_image">

* Taking programming 11 in high school
  * Changed from block-based coding to text-based coding
  * Gave me much more freedom in what I could do
  * Opened up lots of opportunities for me

## Effects of Text-Based Coding on My Life

<img src="/images/pages/reaching_out.jpg" alt="Hands Reaching Out" class="page_image">

* I could make much more complicated coding projects and games
* My skills would be sought out by others:
  * An organization called Callysto
  * A math professor at SFU
  * A lab at SFU

## Example Projects

<div class="gallery" data-columns="3">
  {% for file in site.static_files %}
  {% if file.path contains 'images/gallery/present_coding' %}
  <img src="{{ file.path }}" alt="{{ file.name }}">
  {%endif%}
  {% endfor %}
</div>

## Personal Growth

<img src="/images/pages/personal_growth.png" alt="Personal Growth" class="page_image">

* In middle school, I didn't clearly see how I could apply what I was learning
* Now, I appreciate what I learn much more
  * For example, I used the physics equations I learned in physics 11 in order to have a physics system in one of my games
